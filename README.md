Dev Record
 7/17

Spent day creating framework of website. Using react, splitting components seemed to become more and more useful. May have to monitor performance on deploy.

First use of Sass. Vastly improves CSS workflow and diminishes frustration. Also learned the importance of naming conventions and separations within project. Trial by fire.

React-router-dom is very useful. Will continue to experiment with more features.

Completed day with a good skeleton. Cards and links placed generally. Still need to generate the content for these elements.
